What Is React?
React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library created by Facebook for building user interfaces.
It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.
###(Slide - History)
React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook in 2011 and is one of the most widely used JavaScript frameworks.
He was influenced by XHP, an HTML component framework for PHP. 
It was first deployed on Facebook's newsfeed in 2011 and later on Instagram.com in 2012. 
##(Slide - Companies, whitch use React)
May 2013, React was open-sourced at JSConf in the United States. Since then, developers across the world actively use React
in production. Yahoo, Mozilla, Airbnb, Netflix, and other big companies  use React in production and have supported
the community with useful open-source libraries and tools.
##(Slide - Survey)
According to a 2018 developer survey conducted by HackerRank, 30% of employers were looking for candidates with React skillsets, 
however only 19% of respondents had the required React skills.
##(Slide - What is react component?)
A React component is a bit of code that represents a piece of the page. Each component is a JavaScript function that returns 
a piece of code that represents a piece of a web page.To build a page, we call these functions in a certain order,
put together the result, and show it to the user. There are two main types of components in React.
Class Components and Functional Components. The difference is pretty obvious.
Class components are  classes and Functional Components are functions. 
The only constraint for a functional component is to accept props as an argument and return valid JSX.
##(Slide - Functional component)
The most obvious one difference between functional and class-Components is the syntax.
A functional component is just a plain JavaScript function which accepts props as an argument and returns a React element.
##(Slide - Сlass component)
A class component requires you to extend from React. Component and create a render function which returns a React element. 
This requires more code but will also give you some benefits.
##(Slide - When should i  use class components?)
When should i  use class components?
Because a functional component is just a plain JavaScript function, you cannot use setState() in your component. 
That’s the reason why they also get called functional stateless components.
So everytime you see a functional component you can be sure that this particular component doesn’t have its own state.
If you need a state in your component you will either need to create a class component or you lift the state up 
to the parent component and pass it down the functional component via props.
Another feature which you cannot use in functional components are lifecycle hooks. 
The reason is the same like for state, all lifecycle hooks are coming from the React.Component 
which you extend from in class components.
So if you need lifecycle hooks you should probably use a class component.
##(Slide - Why should I use functional components at all?) 
So why should I use functional components at all?
You might ask yourself why you should use functional components at all, if they remove so many nice features.
But there are some benefits you get by using functional components in React:
Functional component are much easier to read and test because they are plain JavaScript functions without state or lifecycle-hooks
You end up with less code
They help you to use best practices. It will get easier to separate container and presentational 
components because you need to think more about your component’s state if you don’t have access to setState() in your component
The React team mentioned that there may be a performance boost for functional component in future React versions
##(Slide - Advantages of React.js) 
Advantages of React.js
Easy to learn and use for the developers
Components are reusable, which allows the applications to easy to develop and maintain, therefore saves time.
An open source library
Easier to write with JSX
Great development tools which make design and debugging easier.
Virtual DOM in react.js makes developer work faster and user experience better.
##(Slide - Disadvantages of React.js)
Disadvantages of React.js
The high pace of development where the developers should constantly update their skills and develop a new way of doing things.
Poor documentation due to which developers update their own documentation with the evolving of new releases and tools
##(Slide - Conclusion)
To hit the anticipated enterprise’s targets from your business apps, it is important to ensure they are crafted professionally
and in line with the best practices.
You should consider working with a ReactJS
development company that has ample experience in the same tech application for many years. 
You could also hire a ReactJS developer to help you understand the technology and how to lever the business 
for a competitive advantage. A ReactJS developer will help you to craft achievable goals and demonstrate how the business
can use the technology to accelerate growth, raising conversions, cutting on costs, and raising conversion rates.
